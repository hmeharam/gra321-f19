    <h1>Rhythm and Proportion</h1>
    <h2>Horizontal Motion</h2>
    <p>An ancient metaphor: thought is a thread, and the raconteur is a spinner of yarns - but the true storyteller, the poet, is a weaver. The scribes made this old and audible abstraction into a new and visible fact. After long practice, their work took on such an even, flexible texture that they called the written page a textus, which means cloth. The typesetting device, whether it happens to be a computer or a composing stick, functions like a loom. And the typogra- pher, like the scribe, normally aims to weave the text as evenly as possible. Good letterforms are designed to give a lively, even texture, but careless spacing of letters, lines and words can tear this fabric apart.</p>
    <p>Another ancient metaphor: the density of texture in a written or typeset page is called its color. This has nothing to do with red or green ink; it refers only to the darkness or blackness of the letterforms in mass. Once the demands of legibility and logical order are satisfied, evenness of color is the typographer's normal aim. And color depends on four things: the design of the type, the spacing between the letters, the spacing between the words, and the spacing between the lines. None is independent of the others.</p>
    <p>Type is normally measured in picas and points (explained in detail on pages 328-329), but horizontal spacing is measured in ems, and the em is a sliding measure. One em is a distance equal to the type size. In 6 point type, an em is 6 points; in 12 pt type it is 12 points, and in 60 pt type it is 60 points. Thus a one-em space is proportionately the same in any size. Typesetting machines generally divide the em into units, Ems of i8, 36 or 54 units, for example, are commonly found in the older machines. In newer devices, the em is generally a thousand units. Typographers are more likely to divide the em into simple frac- tions: half an em, a third of an em, and so on, knowing that the unit value of these fractions will vary from one machine to the next. Half an em is called an en.</p>
    <p> If text is set ragged right, the word space (the space between words) can be fixed and unchanging. If the text is justified (set flush left and right, like the text in this book), that space must usually be elastic. In either case, the size of the ideal word space varies from one circumstance to another, depending on factors such as letterfit, type color, and size. A loosely fitted or bold face will need a larger interval between the words. At larger sizes, when letterfit is tightened, the spacing of words can be tightened as well. For a normal text face in a normal text size, a typical value for the word space is a quarter of an em, which can be written M/4. (A quarter of an em is typically about the same as, or slightly more than, the set-width of the letter t.) Language has some effect on the word space as well. In highly inflected languages, such as Latin, most word boundaries are marked by grammatical tags, and a smaller space is therefore sufficient. In English and other uninflected languages, good word spacing makes the difference between a line that has to be deci- phered and a line that can be efficiently read.</p>
